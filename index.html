        <p>
          Earlier, this week, this post came across my feed:
          <a href="https://azumbrunnen.me/blog/framer-is-dead/" target="_blank">“Framer is Dead.”</a>
        </p>
        <p><em>Impossible.</em> I've been using it non-stop for the past month.</p>
        <p>Sadly, this post has gotten some traction, and I've seen it pop-up on several round-ups.</p>
        <p>
          Two weeks ago, Framer launched <strong>a new home page design and Smart Components</strong>, with <strong>Variants</strong> coming
          out of Beta. Looking at new features alone, it's very much alive and well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leading case this post made was that Framer was at fault for moving toward React. In doing so, it's alienating designers that
          aren't code-savvy. Or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, over-empowering UX engineers who over-value the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, as if to drive the nail in the coffin: “Framer used to be about playing around. Now it's about building things.” — Frankly,
          I'm not sure why “playing around” and “building things” have to be mutually exclusive.

        <p>Are we talking about the same product?</p>
